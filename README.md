Project Description:
The "Real-time Sound Frequency Spectrum Analyzer" is a Python project that enables users to visualize the frequencies and their corresponding magnitudes of live audio input in real-time. The project utilizes the sounddevice library to capture audio input from the microphone and performs real-time analysis of the frequency spectrum using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The resulting frequency spectrum is then displayed as a plot, with frequency values on the x-axis and magnitude values (in decibels) on the y-axis.

Key Features:

Live Audio Input: The project captures audio input in real-time from the microphone.
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): The audio data is processed using the FFT algorithm to convert it from the time domain to the frequency domain.
Real-time Frequency Spectrum Visualization: The frequency spectrum is continuously updated and displayed as a plot, allowing users to visualize the distribution of frequencies and their corresponding magnitudes.
Adjustable Settings: Users can modify the duration of audio recording, sampling frequency, and update interval of the plot to customize the visualization according to their requirements.
Benefits and Applications:
The Real-time Sound Frequency Spectrum Analyzer project can be beneficial in various domains, including:

Audio Analysis: It provides a visual representation of the frequency content in real-time, enabling users to analyze audio signals for research, music production, sound engineering, and other audio-related applications.
Acoustic Monitoring: It can be used for monitoring and analyzing acoustic environments, such as noise pollution assessment, audio quality control, and audio surveillance systems.
Educational Tool: It serves as an educational resource for students and enthusiasts to understand the concept of frequency analysis and the visualization of sound waves.
Interactive Demonstrations: It can be utilized in interactive installations, exhibitions, or demonstrations to engage users and provide an interactive experience related to audio and sound visualization.
